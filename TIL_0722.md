# Today I Learned... ✨

- Learned how to set up Jupyter Notebook in VSCode — shoutout to my seatmate for the help 🙌  
  The coolest part? You can run Python code **one cell at a time**, which makes it *way* easier to follow what’s happening and debug stuff.  
  No need to run the whole script every time = faster workflow 💨  
  1. Just install the Jupyter Notebook extension  
  2. Then set a keyboard shortcut — I picked `Ctrl + Shift` for running cells 🧠

- Also played around with indexing a super nested dictionary (mock API vibes).  
  It totally gave me flashbacks to my old job where I used to wrestle with complex JSON from real APIs 😅  
  Lowkey fun to get back into it.

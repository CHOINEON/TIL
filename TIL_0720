# TIL: React Native CLI Project Setup

## ✅ What I Did
Installed Node.js
Set up environment variables for React Native 

Installed Yarn as package manager
Initialized project with:

```npx @react-native-community/cli init heyyoung```

### 📱 Why React Native?
React Native is a cross-platform framework for building mobile apps with JavaScript and React. It allows for shared codebase between iOS and Android.

### ⚙️ Why CLI over Expo?
Needed more flexibility and native module support
CLI gives full access to native code and configuration
Better for custom native features or integrations

### 📦 Why Yarn?
Faster and more deterministic dependency management than npm
yarn.lock ensures consistent installs across environments
Preferred for GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for better compatibility and caching
